## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Image Classification
This project is an image classification application built using TensorFlow.js. I'm working on it while taking the Tensorflow: Data Deployment Specialization by Deeplearning.AI on Coursera.

The program prompts you to capture hand gestures representing Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock using your webcam. This data trains the model directly in your browser.

### Features:
- Train a Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock image classifier directly in your web browser.
- Uses TensorFlow.js for on-device machine learning.

### Requirements:
- Python installed on your computer
- Web browser (Chrome recommended)

### How to Use:
1. Navigate to the folder containing your project files.
2. Open a terminal and run: `python3 -m http.server`. This starts a local server.
3. In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/<filename of the HTML file>`. (Replace `<filename of the HTML file>` with the actual name of your HTML file.). For example: 0.0.0.0:8000/rpsls.html

**Note**: For security reasons, it's recommended to use `localhost` instead of `0.0.0.0` when running the server locally.
